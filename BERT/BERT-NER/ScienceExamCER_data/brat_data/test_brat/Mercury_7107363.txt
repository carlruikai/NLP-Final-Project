A group of students compared the effects of fertilizer on the growth of tomato plants. The students gave six tomato plants Fertilizer 1 and six other tomato plants Fertilizer 2. They grew the plants under the same conditions. After several weeks, the students concluded that the tomato plants that received Fertilizer 1 grew taller than those that received Fertilizer 2. Which of the following actions would have increased the accuracy of the results of this investigation?
using different growing conditions for a group of the plants
growing a group of tomato plants without fertilizer
