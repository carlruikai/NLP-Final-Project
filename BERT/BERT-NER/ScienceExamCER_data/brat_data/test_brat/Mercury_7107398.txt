Some researchers predicted that mice could learn their way around a maze quickly if given a food reward. After many trials, the results came back but differed from the hypothesis. How should the researchers proceed?
Show some results that agree with the hypothesis.
Report the results accurately and then form a new hypothesis.
Conduct more trials until the hypothesis is proven.
Rewrite the hypothesis to better match the results.
