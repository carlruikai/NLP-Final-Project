New evidence suggests that "hot spots" may form in response to "twisting" stresses on plates. It is theorized that these stresses may eventually result in the splitting apart of the tectonic plate in the area of the hot spot. Which of the geographic features would be affected most by the splitting of a tectonic plate?
the Himalayas
the Hawaiian Islands
the San Andreas Fault
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
