In many parts of the world, land that is too dry for farming is used for grazing livestock. Overgrazing of these lands destroys the native plants and breaks down the natural soil covering. How does overgrazing result in desertification?
by increasing the rate at which topsoil is eroded
by allowing non-native species to colonize the land
by reducing the food available to livestock
by causing the land to absorb rainfall more quickly
