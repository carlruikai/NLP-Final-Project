Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. On Hirta, sheep with light wool outnumber sheep with dark wool because sheep with light wool
produce more wool
have a more restricted diet
produce fewer offspring each year
have a better chance of surviving and reproducing
