In the past, Native American Indians buried dead fish along with corn seeds. This technique was used because the decomposing dead fish would
provide nutrients for the growing corn plant
eliminate the need for weeding around the corn plant
release oxygen for use by the corn plant
supply all the water needed by the corn plant
