Laundry detergents were once manufactured to contain high concentrations of phosphorus compounds. When waste water containing these compounds ran off into lakes, the phosphorous became a nutrient to algae. As algae populations increased in the lakes, succession accelerated. Over a long time, which would a lake become as a result of the phosphorous in the detergent?
canyon
desert
swamp
river
