A calculation based on the chemical energy of gasoline shows that a car should be able to go 100 miles on a gallon of fuel. When the car was driven on a test track, the car only went 25 miles on a gallon of fuel. What accounts for most of the difference?
the mass of the driver and the fuel carried by the car
the wind resistance between the car and the air nearby
the waste heat from the combustion of fuel in the engine
the friction between the tires and the surface of the track
