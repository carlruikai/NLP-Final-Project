Some scientists theorize plate motion could alter the level of water in Earth's seas. How would the nature of plate motion limit the possible changes in sea level?
by making only small changes
by changing only a few specific ocean basins
by causing changes to occur at very slow rates
by causing paired changes with equal and opposite effects
