In Colonial America, people used ice to help keep foods fresh. They cut the ice from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored the ice in ice houses. They sometimes used hay as an insulator to prevent the ice from melting. If you wanted to build an icehouse today, which of the following would be the best material to use as an insulator?
dried leaves
foam blocks
plastic wrap
rock salt
