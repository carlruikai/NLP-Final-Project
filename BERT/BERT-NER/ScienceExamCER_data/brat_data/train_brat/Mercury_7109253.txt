Scientists have measured the rate of growth of the Atlantic Ocean basin to be about 2 to 3 cm per year. This type of activity coincides with the formation of ridges on the ocean floor. What is the most likely cause of this activity?
erosion from tidal action
the deposition of sediment
the flow of continental basalt
movement from tectonic plates
