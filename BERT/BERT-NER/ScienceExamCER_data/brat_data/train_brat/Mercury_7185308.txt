Estuaries in Florida often have mangrove trees growing in them. The roots of the mangrove trees slow the flow of the water, which allows soil particles to settle. If people were allowed to remove the mangrove trees, how would the estuary environment most likely be affected?
The amounts of nutrients in the water would decrease.
More habitats for fish would be established.
Populations of grasses would increase.
The risk of erosion would be reduced.
