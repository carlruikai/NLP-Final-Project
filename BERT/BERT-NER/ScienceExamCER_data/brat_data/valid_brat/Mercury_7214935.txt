Paper chromatography is a process used to separate mixtures of substances into their components. The components are carried by a mobile phase through a stationary phase made of absorbent paper. An investigation analyzed a sample of black ink to determine its components.Which property allows the components to separate?
the solubility of the components in the mobile phase
the evaporation rate of the components at a certain temperature
the magnetic property of the components
the thickness of the paper used as the stationary phase
