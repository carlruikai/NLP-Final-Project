Four students compared the total mass of the products to the total mass of the reactants after performing three trials of the same chemical reaction. Each student concluded that the total mass of the products was slightly less than the total mass of the reactants. Each student proposed a different explanation as follows. Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase.Which students offered the most reasonable explanations?
Students 1 and 3
Students 1 and 4
Students 2 and 3
Students 2 and 4
