An increase in phosphate levels in a lake increases the population of algae in the lake. Increased algae blocks sunlight into the lake and results in a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the lake's water. Which of the following should be expected as a result?
Plant populations in the lake increase.
More predatory birds feed on lake animals.
Phosphate levels in the lake decrease.
Fish populations in the lake decline.
