Which statement is the best description of what happens in the rock cycle?
Rocks on old mountains are gradually weathered away while mountain building and volcanism form new mountains.
Once formed, rocks stay in place until rocks above them are weathered away, and they reach the surface.
As sedimentary rocks are buried deep below other rocks, they are changed by heat and pressure, eventually return to the surface, and are weathered again.
Younger sedimentary rocks are always deposited on top of older metamorphic or igneous rocks.
