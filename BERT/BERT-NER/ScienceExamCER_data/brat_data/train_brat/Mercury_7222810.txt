In the 17th century, Galileo proposed a hypothesis to explain how suction pumps work. Galileo's hypothesis was disproved, but later it helped Torricelli in the development of an instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure. How did Galileo's hypothesis most likely help with the development of this new technology?
by leading Galileo to design a different technology
by allowing another scientist to critique Galileo's hypothesis
by providing evidence of the effects of atmospheric pressure
by inspiring another scientist to test an alternative hypothesis
