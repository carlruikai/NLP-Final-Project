For a technology project, Kyle came up with an idea to build a model bridge. He wants his bridge to span 50 cm and to support a 1 kg object. According to the engineering design process, which of the following should be Kyle's next step?
construct prototypes of different kinds of bridges
research the different designs of bridges
gather the materials needed to build the bridge
make a drawing to show how to build the bridge
