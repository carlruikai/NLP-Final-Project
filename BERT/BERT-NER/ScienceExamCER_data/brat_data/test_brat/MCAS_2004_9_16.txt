Tides, such as those along the coast of Massachusetts, are caused by gravitational attractions acting on Earth. Why is the gravitational attraction of the Moon a greater factor in determining tides than the gravitational attraction of the much larger Sun?
Earth is much closer to the Moon than to the Sun.
The Sun's gravity is a factor only during the day.
The Moon's core has a much greater density than the Sun's core.
The Sun's mass is smaller than the mass of the Moon.
