The petals of flowers often are brightly colored. These petals provide a benefit for the plant because they â€”
prevent insects from taking pollen to other flowers
hide the plant from predators that would eat its flowers
protect the leaves from injury by birds and insects
attract insects that can carry the pollen needed for plant reproduction
