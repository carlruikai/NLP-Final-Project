Two seismographs are placed 500 km from an active fault line, one on each side of the active fault line. During an earthquake, what most likely accounts for the different readings on the seismographs?
the pull of gravity on the waves
the interaction of light with waves
the differences in the strength of the waves' origins
the different media through which the waves travel
