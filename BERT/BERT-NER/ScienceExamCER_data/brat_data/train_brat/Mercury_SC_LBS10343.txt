The weight of heavy machinery compacts soil, especially when it is wet. Why do farmers avoid driving their machinery across wet ground?
Compacted soil will absorb too much water.
Plants cannot grow when soil is compacted.
Minerals are destroyed when soil is compacted.
Compacted soil increases soil acidity.
