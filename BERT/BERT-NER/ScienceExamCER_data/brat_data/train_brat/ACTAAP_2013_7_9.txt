Why should plants be included in investigations about the water cycle?
Plants speed up the water cycle by removing carbon from the air.
Plants start the water cycle when they make water in photosynthesis.
Plants are part of the water cycle through the process of transpiration.
Plants stop the water cycle because they absorb it and stop the flow to streams.
