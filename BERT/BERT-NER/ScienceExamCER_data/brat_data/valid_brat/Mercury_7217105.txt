How does a parachute sufficiently increase air resistance to allow the parachutist to land safely?
by decreasing the force of gravity acting on the parachutist
by decreasing the total mass of the parachutist
by increasing the surrounding air pressure around the parachute
by increasing the total surface area of the parachute
