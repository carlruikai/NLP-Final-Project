A student notices that an inflated balloon gets larger when it is warmed by a lamp. Which best describes the mass of the balloon as a result of this change?
The mass of the balloon increases because the size of the balloon has increased.
The mass of the balloon increases because the temperature of the balloon has increased.
The mass of the balloon stays the same because the gas inside the balloon still has the same mass after it warms up.
The mass of the balloon stays the same because warming decreases the mass enough to cancel out the effect of increasing the size.
