A population of small, plant-eating beetles lives in a forest. About half of the beetles are light brown and the others are dark green. If years of drought cause the area to become dry with few trees, what would the beetle population most likely look like after several generations?
It would be mostly light brown beetles.
It would be mostly dark green beetles.
It would be mostly carnivorous beetles.
It would be mostly very large beetles.
