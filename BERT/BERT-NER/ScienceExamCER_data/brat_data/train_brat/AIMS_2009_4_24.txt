Tyrone put two stones in a plastic bottle of water and shook it. After he stopped shaking the bottle, he observed that small pieces of the stones were floating in the water. What is the best prediction he can make based on this observation? If shaking the bottle causes pieces of stones to break off,
then using cold water will break off more pieces.
then using hot water will make the stones change colors.
then shaking for a longer amount of time will break off more pieces.
then shaking for a shorter amount of time will make the rocks change colors.
