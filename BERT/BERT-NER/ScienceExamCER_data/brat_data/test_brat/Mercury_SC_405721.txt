Christina kicks a ball. The ball moves faster when she kicks it on the concrete sidewalk than when she kicks it on the grass. Why does the ball travel slower on the grass than the sidewalk?
The grass has more friction.
The grass attracts more wind.
The grass has a higher temperature.
The grass increases Earth's gravity.
