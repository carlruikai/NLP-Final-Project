Why do mountain climbers at high elevations use oxygen tanks to help them breathe?
At high elevations the ozone layer draws oxygen out of the atmosphere.
The atmosphere is less dense at higher elevations so there is less oxygen available.
Oxygen is heavier than the other gases in the atmosphere and sinks to lower elevations.
Radiation from the Sun splits oxygen molecules into atoms making the oxygen unbreathable.
