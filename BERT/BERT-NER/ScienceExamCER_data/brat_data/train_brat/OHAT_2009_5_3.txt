A mosquito is a type of flying insect that lays eggs in puddles or small pools of water. When larvae develop from eggs, the larvae come to the surface to get air through special breathing tubes. After one to two weeks, the larvae become pupae and then turn into adults. How would a dry summer affect a mosquito population?
The mosquito larvae would take longer to become pupae.
The adult mosquitoes would have fewer places to lay eggs.
The adult mosquitoes would get fluids by feeding more often.
The mosquito larvae would use their breathing tubes to live on land.
