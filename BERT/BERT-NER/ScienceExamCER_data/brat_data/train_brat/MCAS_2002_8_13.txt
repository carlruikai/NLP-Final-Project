Why do areas in the middle of a large continent generally have more extreme differences in temperature than areas near the coastline?
There are generally more clouds near the oceans.
Landlocked areas are usually at a lower altitude than coastline areas.
Coastlines are usually surrounded by mountains that block air masses.
Oceans change temperature slowly and regulate the temperature of nearby land.
