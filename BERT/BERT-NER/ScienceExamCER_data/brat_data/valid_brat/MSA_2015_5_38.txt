Offshore oil platforms affect ocean habitats. An ocean environment is most likely damaged by an offshore oil platform because
leaking oil from the oil platform might pollute the water
fishing from the oil platform might reduce the fish population
drilling in the ocean floor might reduce the water temperature
changing the ocean floor might increase the number of hurricanes
