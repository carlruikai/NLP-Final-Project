Wolves have adapted skills for hunting large hoofed animals such as elk, deer, or moose. Wolves tend to target prey animals that are sick or weak. The wolf benefits from this strategy because it uses less energy to hunt. How would the prey animal population also benefit from this strategy?
by promoting detrimental genes
by stimulating beneficial DNA mutations
by preventing the introduction of other predator species
by increasing the reproductive success of healthy prey animals
