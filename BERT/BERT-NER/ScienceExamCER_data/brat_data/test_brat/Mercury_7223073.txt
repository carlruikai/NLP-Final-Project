A scientist designs a mathematical model of the rock cycle. The model predicts how changes in Earth processes will affect the amounts of different types of rock on Earth. Which quantity should stay the same as Earth processes change?
the average rate at which Earth rotates
the average distance of Earth from the Sun
the total number of inactive volcanoes on Earth
the total amount of material on Earth
