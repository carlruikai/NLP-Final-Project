Stem cells are cells that can differentiate into many different kinds of cells. Scientists have discovered that the environment supporting the cells influences stem-cell differentiation. For example, stem cells grown on strong, flexible surfaces became muscle cells. What most likely happened to stem cells grown on a hard, rigid surface?
They became nerve cells.
They became red blood cells.
They became bone cells.
They became skin cells.
