The endangered Florida manatee is a large, aquatic mammal that feeds on sea grasses in brackish water. Due to where they like to feed, manatees are vulnerable to injuries from boat propellers. If speed zones requiring boats to maintain a low speed are placed in areas where manatees are known to congregate, which will most likely occur?
less water pollution in manatee habitats will occur
manatees will seek alternate food sources
new manatee predators will surface
manatee populations will increase
