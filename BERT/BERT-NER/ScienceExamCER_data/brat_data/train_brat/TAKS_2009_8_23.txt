Two students make hot chocolate. One student pours the hot chocolate into a foam cup. The other student pours the hot chocolate into a metal cup. The metal cup becomes too hot to touch, but the foam cup can be held comfortably. The best explanation for this difference in temperature is that the foam cup-- A heats up much faster than the metal cup
has a higher specific heat than the metal cup
is a better conductor of heat than the metal cup
has a specific heat that is similar to that of the metal cup
