The equation below shows the products formed when a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3) reacts with a solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). AgNO3 + NaCl (Reactants) -> NaNO3 + AgCl (Products) In this equation, the total mass of the reactants is
greater than the total mass of the products
equal to the total mass of the products
equal to the mass of AgCl
less than the mass of AgCl
