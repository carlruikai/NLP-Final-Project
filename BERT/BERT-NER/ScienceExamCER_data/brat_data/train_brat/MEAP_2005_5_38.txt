As an airplane climbs in the sky, the pilot notices ice crystals forming on the windshield. This happens because
blizzards occur more often at higher altitudes.
friction with the atmosphere causes ice to develop.
water evaporates faster at higher altitudes, resulting in ice crystals.
moisture on the outside of the plane freezes due to colder air at higher altitudes.
