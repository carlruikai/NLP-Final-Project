Plumes of water vapor have been observed rising from the southern polar region of Enceladus, one of the moons of Saturn. A team of scientists proposed an explanation for the plumes and developed a model. They also published calculations based on their model. These calculations would most likely be used for which purpose in future research?
testing the hypothesis
evaluating similar events
mapping routes for exploration
checking the validity of observations
