Cheetahs have come close to extinction due to hunting, drought, and disease. There is now very little genetic variation in cheetah populations. Which of the following is a result of the limited genetic variation in the current cheetah populations compared to earlier cheetah populations with more variation?
Cheetahs in current populations are more resistant to new diseases.
The survival rate of young cheetahs is increased in current populations.
Cheetahs in current populations are less able to interbreed with other species.
The current cheetah populations are less likely to be able to adapt to environmental changes.
