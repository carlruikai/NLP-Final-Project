The yellow-throated longclaw is a bird that lives on the dry savanna of Africa. It looks almost exactly like another bird, the western meadowlark of North America. Although the birds look very similar, they are not even in the same taxonomic family. Scientists think the birds look alike because the two species developed under similar environmental pressures, even though they developed thousands of miles apart. Which process does their development demonstrate?
sexual selection
disruptive selection
divergent evolution
convergent evolution
