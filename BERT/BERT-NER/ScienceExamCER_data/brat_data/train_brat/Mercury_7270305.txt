Many horses grow a heavy coat in autumn and shed that coat in spring. Scientists were not sure if temperature or the amount of daylight per day (called the photoperiod) caused the change. So, they conducted an experiment and concluded that the change in photoperiod was responsible for the biological changes. Shedding caused by which set of conditions would have helped them arrive at this conclusion?
a constant photoperiod, but varied temperatures
a varied photoperiod, and varied temperatures
a constant photoperiod, and a constant temperature
a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature
