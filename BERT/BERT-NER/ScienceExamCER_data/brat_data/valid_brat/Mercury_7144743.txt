The Florida Bog Frog (Lithobates okaloosae) inhabits shallow stream overflows in three counties in Florida. With such a small geographic habitat, any change in the frog's environment could cause drastic changes in the population. Which would most likely affect the frog population if acid rain changed the pH of the water?
Prey insects would become inedible.
Tadpoles would be unable to survive.
Breeding sites would become unavailable.
Predators would choose another food source.
