What is a difference between mitosis and meiosis?
Mitosis occurs in all the cells in animals and plants, while meiosis occurs in only in bacteria.
In mitosis, the products are identical to the parent cell, while in meiosis the products are different from the parent cell.
In mitosis, one cell divides into two cells, while in meiosis two cells combine to make one cell.
Mitosis involves separating the chromosomes, while meiosis involves only the cytoplasm of the cell.
