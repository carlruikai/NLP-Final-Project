Climate change may be reducing the amount of ice floating on the world's oceans. How can this change most likely alter the food supply available to marine consumer organisms?
by decreasing the amount of salt dissolved in ocean water
by increasing the water's ability to separate into distinct layers
by changing temperature conditions that single-celled producers require
by preventing organisms from responding quickly to environmental change
