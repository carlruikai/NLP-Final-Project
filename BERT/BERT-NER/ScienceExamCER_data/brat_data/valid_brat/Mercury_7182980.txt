When a cold front moves over a land region that has warm, moist air, a transfer of energy occurs. Cold air sinks and pushes warmer air upward. As energy is removed from the air, which change will most likely take place?
Ozone in the atmosphere will decrease.
Less ultraviolet radiation will reach the land.
More water will be absorbed from the area lakes.
Water in the atmosphere will undergo a phase change.
