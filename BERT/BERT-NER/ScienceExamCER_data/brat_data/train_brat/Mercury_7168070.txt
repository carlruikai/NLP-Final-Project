Several horses grazed in a fenced area across from a home. On rainy days, soil would wash down a slope and run toward the home. After the horses were moved a few years later, the soil no longer washed down when it rained. What could account for this change?
The grass grew and kept the soil intact.
The fence kept the soil contained.
The soil was completely gone.
The amount of rain decreased.
