How does the tilt of Earth’s axis and its rotation affect the weather?
The tilt of Earth allows Earth to absorb all of the Sun’s radiation as it rotates.
The tilt allows certain latitudes of Earth to be heated at a greater rate while Earth rotates.
The tilt of Earth allows Earth to rotate fast enough to allow surface cooling to occur at night.
The tilt allows energy to be evenly distributed throughout the atmosphere while Earth rotates.
