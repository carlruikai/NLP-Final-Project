In early 2003, the Human Genome Project identified the sequence of base pairs in the genes in human DNA. With all of this information, many of the functions of the genes are still unknown. Currently, scientists are studying many of these genes in order to learn more about them. What is the significance of this new genetic discovery?
It can provide new methods for creating diseases.
It can lead to faster chromosome replication.
It can lead to a simpler structure for DNA.
It can provide new ways to treat diseases.
