Rain forests contain more species of trees than any other biome. However, scientists have found that the soil of the forest floor is relatively nutrient poor. What could most likely account for this?
The lack of weathering reduces the availability of the minerals.
The nutrients are being utilized by the plant life.
The forest floor does not get enough sunlight.
The animals eat the nutrients.
