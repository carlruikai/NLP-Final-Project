An artificial pacemaker is a device that regulates the beat of the heart by an electrical stimulus. Some early pacemakers were powered by batteries and were worn externally with wires passing through the skin to the surface of the heart. Modern pacemakers are now much smaller and are implanted surgically. Which most likely has increased the lifespan and effectiveness of artificial pacemakers?
the development of thinner wires
the invention of lithium batteries
mass production of pacemaker parts
reducing the cost of producing pacemakers
