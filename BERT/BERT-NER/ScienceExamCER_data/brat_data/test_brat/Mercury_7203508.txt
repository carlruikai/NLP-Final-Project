The numbat, a small Australian marsupial, requires fallen logs and dead trees for shelter and for its primary food, termites. Loss of old-growth forests containing logs and dead trees could threaten the numbat with extinction. What would be the best method to protect the numbat from extinction?
provide feeding stations with termites for the numbats
protect areas of old-growth forest from clear-cutting
prohibit hiking in forests where numbats live
move the numbat to a different habitat
